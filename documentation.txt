Make local folder called it comp698-final
Went to github, udner repo, clicked new, called it comp698-final
•	initialize it with a README.md
•	license- MIT license
After creating repo, clicked Clone or Download 
Opened terminal, went to Desktop folder called COMP698
In COMP698, wrote, cloned repo from github
•	configure the Github repo to protect your master branch
•	Go to Settings (for repo comp698-final)>branches> Branch protection rules>choose master, select Protect this branch, select, Require status checks to pass before merging, select include administrators, hit save changes 
On local repo copy, created two files 
-	Main.go
-	Main_test.go
Input code given (https://github.com/mathyourlife/comp698-final/tree/helloworld-source) 
In terminal located my local repo with the two files, did this twice for main.go and main_test.go 
Push changes to github by
adding a branch
Commit message 
pull request through github
merge to master

Create local docker file
Open text editor, copy docker file components from (https://github.com/mathyourlife/comp698-final/blob/master/Dockerfile)
Push changes to github by
adding a branch
Commit message 
pull request through github
merge to master
**Check what latest commit on github to make sure it matches local copy
-	On terminal, type git log and compare the latest commit with repo on github, if the commit numbers are different then complete step below
-	In terminal type, git checkout master, git pull, then compare again, they should be the same commit numbers now 
-      Best practice is to run git log and status every so often to make sure the latest commit numbers match the local repo and the Github repo

Add .travis.yml file to local repo and push it to github for pull request validation 
Push changes to github by
adding a branch
Commit message 
pull request through github
merge to master
configure travis CI on https://travis-ci.org/lmukanovic/comp698-final
*Professor added file .travis.yml (accepted PR) had error on terminal, fixed it through 
git checkout master
rm .travis.yml
git pull



Go to GCP, and search for Build Trigger 
Create trigger,
Select github repo (comp698-final)
Name, branch master
Image name- gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$REPO_NAME:$COMMIT_SHA
After creating, hit run trigger to master, wait until it builds successful 


In comp698-final, create a subfolder calling it terraform 
-	add terraform configuration files to your github repo in a terraform subdirectory
-	copied from webserver and changed names and added new image 
       
push local changes to github in terraform folder 
Push changes to github by
adding a branch
Commit message 
pull request through github
merge to master

login to terraform configuration server and run the file with terraform apply 
-	gcloud compute ssh terraform-configuration 
git clone comp698-final to terraform-configuration server
cd terraform
ls
you'll see main.tf 
run terraform apply 
saw error,
running terraform init
again terraform apply 
-	name not available trying again-renaming image name at the bottom of main.tf then doing the same steps to push work from local repo, to Github repo then to terraform-configuration server 
Push changes to github by,
adding a branch
Commit message 
pull request through github
merge to master

On terraform-configuration server to pull down latest code do 
git checkout master
git pull
**Travis is giving me a weird error but GCP/Terraform is working correctly
Compute Engine>staging-18x7>External IP (http://104.154.162.161) gives me Hello World! 

Updating the main.go, main_test.go, Dockerfile, functional-test.sh files (Travis CI is working now, it needed the functional-test.sh file)
Then doing git add, commit, pull request, travis, merge to master for each of them 

Logining into terraform-configuration server
- Gcloud compute ssh terraform-configuration

Added final resource to main.tf  then 
Git branch 
Git checkout branch
Git add main.tf
Git commit –m 
Git push origin [branchname]

Worked, going into terraform server to run from there 
Terraform/main.tf
Terraform apply 

Didn’t work, trying again
Added final resource to main.tf  then 
Git branch 
Git checkout branch
Git add main.tf
Git commit –m 
Git push origin [branchname]

Got it to work but it was swapped 
Production was the production
Staging was the hello world 

In order to make it work I swapped the image that was on staging to the production image on main.tf under metadata/containers

Final result of production showing "Hello World" and staging/home showing bootstrap server can be found under GCP>Compute Engine>VM Instances (must be running it through terraform-configuration server first)
