What purpose does Travis CI serve?
* It is a service that uses continuious integration with our github repo as we create pull requests and modify our code. Travis CI runs our program's tests every time there is a commit to GitHub. You can configure this i many ways, and you can always disable builds on some branches. The main use of Travis CI is to quickly discover if your commit(s) broke something, and fix it before it becomes a problem.

Why use bash commands vs clicking through UI?
* Using bash commands allows us to become more proficient in knowing linux (for Mac users) and powershell (for Windows users). Bash commands are quick and effective which create a local repo with a couple of steps. Clicking through the UI can create some problems with the local and git repo that are unable to be fixed. In addition, there are more features that you can utilize through a bash command over clicking through the UI. Bash commands are stored and able to be accessed later on, while clicking through the UI is not stores and users have a hard time remembering what they did.
